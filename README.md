Fraudulent Transaction Prediction for a Financial Company
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The objective is to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, protecting the company and its customers from potential financial losses and reputational damage..
Dataset
The dataset provided for this project is in CSV format and consists of 500,000 rows and 10 columns. Each row represents a transaction and contains information such as the type of transaction, transaction amount, customer details (nameOrig, nameDest), initial and new balances before and after the transaction, and flags indicating fraudulent or illegal attempts. The "isFraud" column indicates whether the transaction was made by fraudulent agents within the simulation, while the "isFlaggedFraud" column flags transactions that attempt to transfer more than $200,000 in a single transaction. The dataset covers a 30-day simulation, with each step representing one hour of time.
Approach and Model Evaluation
To predict fraudulent transactions, various machine learning models were evaluated. After thorough experimentation, Gradient Boosting emerged as the best performing model. It achieved an accuracy of 98% and demonstrated a good recall of 98% for both fraudulent and non-fraudulent classes.
To address class imbalance in the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed. SMOTE generates synthetic samples of the minority class, balancing the dataset and allowing the model to learn from a more representative distribution of fraudulent transactions.
Conclusion
The developed model for predicting fraudulent transactions in the financial domain achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98% and demonstrated a good recall of 98% for both fraudulent and non-fraudulent classes. By utilizing Gradient Boosting and applying SMOTE to address class imbalance, we effectively mitigated the risks associated with fraud. This model can be integrated into the financial company's system to proactively identify and prevent fraudulent activities, safeguarding the company's assets and maintaining the trust of its customers.
